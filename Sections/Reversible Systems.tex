Many mechanical systems have time-reversal symmetry.
This means that their dynamics look the same whether time runs forward or backward.
A second-order system \emph{reversible system} is invariant under $t\rightarrow-t$ and $y\rightarrow-y$.
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:rs2d}}
	\begin{aligned}
		\dot{x}&=f(x,y)\\
		\dot{y}&=g(x,y)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is odd in $y$ and $g$ is even in $y$.
\subsection*{Nonlinear Centers}
\begin{theorem}[\textbf{Nonlinear centers for reversible systems}]
	Suppose the origin $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}=\mathbf{0}$ is a linear center for the reversible continuously differentiable system (\ref{eq:rs2d}).
	Then sufficiently close to the origin, all trajectories are \textbf{closed curves}.
\end{theorem}
