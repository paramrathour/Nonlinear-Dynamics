\subsubsection{The Forced Undamped Pendulum}
We add the external force to the expression for $\varphi^{\prime\prime}$.
We assume that this force is periodic in the time $t$, even that it has a simple cosine shape.
\begin{equation}
	\varphi^{\prime\prime}=-\omega^2\sin\varphi+A\cos\Omega t
\end{equation}
We show two motions in the diagrams of Figure (\ref{fig:tfcup}).
In both cases, $\Omega=1, A=0.01, \varphi(0)=0.017, \varphi^\prime(0)=0$, and the time interval is $[0,200]$.
The free pendulum oscillates with a well-defined frequency and also the forcing has a well-defined frequency.
In the motions depicted in Figure (\ref{fig:tfcup}) both frequencies remain visible. Like \emph{multi} or \emph{quasi}\emph{-periodic} motion (Section (\ref{sec:paqp})).

\subsubsection{The Forced Damped Pendulum}
Adding damping, we arrive at the following equation of motion
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:tfcdp}}
	\varphi^{\prime\prime}=-\omega^2\sin\varphi-c\ \varphi^\prime+A\cos\Omega t
\end{equation}
In Figure (\ref{fig:tfcdp}) we took $\omega=1.43, \Omega=1, A=0.2, c=0.1 and \varphi(0)=0.3, \varphi^\prime(0)=0$ we show an example of a motion of the damped forced pendulum (\ref{eq:tfcdp}), that only after a long time (say about 100 time units) tends to a periodic motion. 
It can be shown that the system, with equation of motion (\ref{eq:tfcdp}) with well-chosen values of the parameters $\omega$, $c$, $A$ and $\Omega$, has motions that never tend to a periodic motion, i.e. \emph{Chaos}.
