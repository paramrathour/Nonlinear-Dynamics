One Dimensional Systems are basically those in equation (\ref{eq:gode}) with $n=2$.
Two-dimensional dynamical systems can be represented by either a single differential equation of second order, which contains a second derivative with respect to time, or by two equations of first order.
In general, a second order system can always be expressed as two first order equations.
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:2d}}
	\begin{aligned}
		\dot{x}&=f(x,y)\\
		\dot{y}&=g(x,y)
	\end{aligned}\quad\text{or}\quad
	\ddot{x}+f(x,\dot{x})=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad 
	\begin{cases} 
		\dot{x}=y&\\
		\dot{y}=-f(x,\dot{x})&
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
