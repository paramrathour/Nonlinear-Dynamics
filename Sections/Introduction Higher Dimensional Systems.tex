The existence and uniqueness theorem (\ref{thm:eut}) holds.\\
Linear Stability Analysis and Potential Functions both generalize from lower dimensional analogues.
\begin{theorem}
	Consider the differential equation
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbf{\dot{x}}=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})\quad\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n
	\end{equation*}
	Suppose that $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{0})=\mathbf{0}$ and that the Jacobian matrix has $n$ eigenvalues with nonzero real part.
	Then, in a small neighborhood of $\mathbf{x}=0$, there exist stable and unstable manifolds with the \emph{same dimensions} as the stable and unstable manifolds of the linearized system
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbf{\dot{x}}=J\mathbf{x}
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
