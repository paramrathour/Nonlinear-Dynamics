Population ecologists use a variety of mathematical methods to model population dynamics (how populations change in size and composition over time).
Some of these models represent growth without environmental constraints, while others include `ceilings' determined by limited resources.
Mathematical models of populations can be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a population and, importantly, to predict future changes.
