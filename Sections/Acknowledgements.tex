	This project is a part of the \emph{Summer of Science} of the \emph{Maths and Physics Club IIT Bombay}.
	Thanks to my parents for motivating me to stay productive during this ``CoronaVacation''.
	I would like to express gratitude to my mentor Athul for helping me in my submissions, providing resources.
	I followed \cite{book:1} and \cite{book:2} for studying.
	The content here is inspired by these books, many figures and explanations are directly taken from these books.
	And, lastly thanks to you, reader, I have worked hard in making this report, in the hope that this work helps you in some way.
