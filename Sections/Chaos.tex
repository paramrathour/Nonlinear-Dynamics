A dynamical system is chaotic if it possesses all of the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The dynamical rule is \textbf{deterministic}.
	\item The orbits are \textbf{aperiodic}.
	\item The orbits are \textbf{bounded}.
	\item The dynamical system has \textbf{sensitive dependence on initial conditions\footnote{A function $f$ has sensitive dependence on initial conditions if there is some number $\delta$ such that for any $x_0$ there is a $y_0$ that is not more that $\epsilon$ away from $x_0$, where the initial condition $y_0$ has the property that there is some integer $n$ such that, after $n$ iterates, the orbit of $y_0$ is more than $\delta$ away from the orbit of $x_0$. That is, $|x_n-y_n|>\delta$.}}.
\end{itemize}
We have already seen examples of Chaos Section ((\ref{sec:ls}),(\ref{sec:rs}),(\ref{sec:lm}),(\ref{sec:hm})).
