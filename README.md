Nonlinear Dynamics
==================

This repository contains my report on **Nonlinear Dynamics** and its
corresponding files for *Summer of Science* conducted by *Maths and Physics Club
IIT Bombay*.

### Introduction

Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos is a blend of applied mathematics and physical
modelling, spreading across scientific disciplines like a spider's intricate
web. It has provided new theoretical and conceptual tools that allow us to
capture, understand, and link together the surprisingly complex behaviours of
simple systems. It offers some markedly different perspectives on chance and
determinism in scientific explanations of phenomena, mechanical systems versus
complex adaptive system, the concepts of dimensions and complexity, and basic
notions of change and equilibria.

Here, we study the mathematics behind this topic and explore its application in
various fields.

This report is divided into parts: One Dimensional Systems followed by Two
Dimensional Systems then Higher Dimensional stuff and then Discrete Dynamical
Systems. Next, we examine Stochastic Systems. On our way, we will look at
corresponding Linear Systems to gain insight onto Nonlinear ones. Then, we
explore Chaos and Fractals. Finally, I encourage you to look at Mathematical
Models and their exciting results.
